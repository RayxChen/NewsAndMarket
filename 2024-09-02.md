## Stocks Slip as Traders Brace for September Swings

- Brace for NFP & rates cut

- NFP: 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on the first Friday of every month.

- NFP trading: EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, XAU/USD (high liquidity, volatility, volumes)

Normal practice: Wait for the market to settle after initial swings, then enter positions in the direction of the dominant momentum. This approach reduces the risk of entering too early and getting caught in a false move.
